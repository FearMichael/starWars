This is a fun game to play to save the galaxy..

## Why
- To practice javascript enhanced with jQuery coding skills
- Continue learning front-end / boostrap skills

## Gameplay
- The good guys are enhanced with a damage multiplier while the bad guys are not.
- ONE good guy must defeat all of the bag guys without dying.

### Enhancements / Improvements for future
- Add better game ending - simply ran out of time to make this something more substantial
- Smooth out transitions on screen (sometimes jumpy/stutter)
- Game is unbalanced, need tuning for a more challenging experience.

#### Enjoy!
